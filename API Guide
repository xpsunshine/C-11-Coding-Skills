API Guide

This page serves as a comprehensive reference for the Graphene API and its blockchain, such as BitShares 2.0 and MUSE.

APIs are separated into two categories, namely:

    1、the Blockchain API which is used to query blockchain data (account, assets, trading history, etc.) and
    2、the Wallet API which has your private keys loaded and is required when interacting with the blockchain with new transactions.

Note

In order to interface with the wallet, you need to run the CLI Wallet. Neither the light-wallet, nor the hosted web wallet will provide you with an API.

The wallet (cli_wallet) requires a running full node to connect to because it does not offer P2P or blockchain capabilities directly.
钱包需要一个正在运行的完整节点来连接，因为它不直接提供P2P或区块链功能。

wallet.cpp:
1、struct wallet_data
2、class wallet_api_impl
